# One-shot classification using Siamese Neural Network
A test implementation of one-shot classification task using Siamese neural netowrk.

## Requirements
- Install [cuda-8.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downlaods)
- Install [cudnn-v5.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
- Install [Pytorch 0.4.0](https://pytorch.org/)
- Python version >= 3.5 is required

## Implementation Notes
- Used Omniglot dataset
- Same structure proposed in the paper, [Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf)
- Only small amount of dataset was used for testing purpose.
- Experimental setups and details might differ from the paper.
